# starter

A sample project demonstrating the use of SakuraApi.

This sample provides a REST API to HTTP GET a collection of users or an individual user.

You should be able to:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Which will start the server. You can then browse to:

* http://localhost:8001/api/user (read all users)
* http://localhost:8001/api/user/1 (read George Washington)
* http://localhost:8001/api/user/2 (read John Adams)
